# World of Whatever

This little project was created as part of the [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/) tutorial.  Throughout the course, there is an ongoing text-based adventure game project where each new increment uses the new material that the student has learned.  The student is strongly encouraged to go above and beyond to add their own material and I did just that, by adding my own:

* Character class with health and stats, and Item class so the player can use and equip items

* elaborate puzzle that spans multiple rooms

* rudimentary battle engine that pits you against an epic final boss (if you can find them...)

The code is very basic since I was only learning, but the game itself is cute.

## Getting started

Download all the files into the same folder, navigate there in Terminal/CMD, and (assuming you have Ruby installed) type

' ruby main.rb '
